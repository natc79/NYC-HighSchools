# NYC-HighSchools
Analyzes latest data on NYC high schools.  This data can be obtained from https://data.cityofnewyork.us.  It combines multiple datasets to analyze which schools are performing the best in terms of SAT scores.  It then suggests a revised score to measure school performance that is developed from deviations from the predicted score based on some key determining characteristics of SAT scores.  Please see the jupyter notebook file for the writeup and analysis.
